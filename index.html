    <p class="intro">NYC- Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for New York City women. But, fewer women have died of the disease over the past eight years, even lower for white women. Non-hispanic black and hispanic women are more
      susceptible to heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol levels, according to data by the Center for Disease Control.

      <iframe title="Decline in the Rate of Death by Heart Disease in NYC Women" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-WefAz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WefAz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
        style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="390"></iframe>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        ! function() {
          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")

      </script>
    </div>

    <p>The death-by-heart-disease rate for White women dropped by 36 percent from 2007 to 2014, 19 percent for Black women and 13 percent for Hispanic women. </p>
    <p> Recent achievements in science and laws passed, such as the Affordable Care Act have helped to provide preventive care and screening for women, thereby reducing heart diseases.
